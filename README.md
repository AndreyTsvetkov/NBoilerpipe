NBoilerpipe is a C# port of Boilerpipe 1.2 (http://code.google.com/p/boilerpipe/) library. Most of the code is converted  with the Sharpen tool (https://github.com/slluis/sharpen.) The code uses the Sharpen libary (with modification) from NGit project (https://github.com/slluis/ngit) and HmtlAgilityPack (http://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/.)
