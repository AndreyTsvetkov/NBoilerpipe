NBoilerpipe is a C# port of boilerpipe 1.2 (http://code.google.com/p/boilerpipe/) library.  Most of the code is converted  with the Sharpern tool (https://github.com/slluis/sharpen). The code uses the Sharpern libary (with modification) from NGit project (https://github.com/slluis/ngit) and HmtlAgilityPack (http://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/).
